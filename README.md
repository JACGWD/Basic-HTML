# Basic-HTML
Basic HTML template used as the basis of web classes above Web III at GWD.

Note that the base HTML is that from the [HTML 5 Boilerplate project](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). The difference here is that the basic template is heavily commented for ease of use by beginners. The advanced template contains many metatags for SEO and social media optimizations.
