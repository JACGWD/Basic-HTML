<!--
The detail page uses base.html for it's HTML. The only difference is what will be found inside <main>.

A "detail" page's role is to display the details of a certain item that was in the master page. For example if the master had a choice of shoes displayed as a grid of thumbnails, the detail page is what gets loaded when the thumbnail is clicked. The details include price, size, available colors, etc.
