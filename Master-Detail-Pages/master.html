<!--
A "master" page has many links/thumbnails that point to a set of related pages.

For example, a master page would have images and links of a set of products such as shoes. Each detail page would be one single item from that list, such as laced-dress-shoes.html or minus-40-winter-boots.html.

By default, the master page has a lot of information on it and points to a page with specific information about one specific thing.
